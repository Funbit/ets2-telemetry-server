# Telemetry reference

This document describes all telemetry properties supported by the [ETS2 Telemetry Web Server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server). 

## Property types

#### boolean

A boolean value that can be either true or false.

#### integer

An integer value. Example: 40

#### float

A floating point value. Example: 40.1233

#### date

Date types are always serialized to [ISO 8601 ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)string in [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone. Counting starts from 0001 year when 1st January is Monday. Example: "0001-01-05T05:11:00Z".

If you want to convert date string to Javascript date object inside dashboard.js skin file you may use the following technique:

    var nextRestStopTimeDate = new Date(data.game.nextRestStopTime);
    var hours = nextRestStopTimeDate.getUTCHours();   
    var minutes = nextRestStopTimeDate.getUTCMinutes();
	...

For more information about Javascript date object see [the reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).
